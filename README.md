Welcome to the taschenrech-polnisch


here are some information when using this program:

1.please use Git Bash or a Linux Terminal to open
the jar file, otherwise the color escape codes will
not be translated into colors and written out into the
terminal. which could lower the user-experience.

2.the jar file is saved in taschenrechner-polnisch/out

3.to use the program you'll need to change the direction
of your terminal to ..\taschenrechner-polnisch\out, ..
means the path on which u travel to get to the downloaded
file and then use the command: java jar- taschenrechner_polnisch.jar

4.have fun testing it :) and if you are bored try to crash it.
The program should be unbreakable.
