Welcome to the taschenrech-polnisch

here are some information when using this program:

1.please use a Linux terminal or Git Bash to open
the jar file, otherwise the color escape codes will
not be translated into colors and written out into the
terminal. which could lower the user-experience.


2.the jar file is saved in taschenrechner-polnisch/out

3.to use the program you'll need to change the direction
of your terminal to ..\taschenrechner-polnisch\out, ..
means the path on which u travel to get to the downloaded
file and then use the command java jar- taschenrechner-polnisch.jar

4.have fun testing it :) and if you are bored try to crash it.
The program should be unbreakable.

General RULEs:

-all RPN rules are working.

-"e" will be used as the euler number

-"pi" will be used as the circular number

-hexadecimal numbers start with 0x or 0X and binary numbers with 0b or 0B

-typing "quit" will end the program or ask you if u want to end it
when you type it in the middle of a calculation-line
